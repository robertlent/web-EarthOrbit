This is an HTML, CSS, and JS project that I created that shows the Moon orbiting the Earth, while the Earth orbits the Sun.

I originally created this project using no Javascript, and with the Earth and Moon orbiting much quicker, but have since modified it in the following ways:

    -- I slowed down the orbit of both objects, so that the Earth takes about 365 seconds to go around the Sun, and the Moon takes about 29 seconds to go around the Earth.
    -- I added Javscript and additional CSS so that when the page is clicked, the Earth and Moon will orbit faster, with the Earth taking about 12 seconds to orbit the Sun and the Moon taking about 1 second.
